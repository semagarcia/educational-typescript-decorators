# Educational Typescript Decorators
Educational repository with an small set of typescript decorators.

* Class decorator
* Method decorator
* Parameter decorator
* Property decorator

As the name implies, each decorator is applied on a different level, with its own purpose and meaning. I will go deeper with further details in the next sections.
